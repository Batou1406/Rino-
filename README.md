# Rino-
Repository for the Rino project, the hand-free polyvalent tool. Develloped during Lauzhack-Covid19 to avoid contaminations during everyday life interactions. The tool is made to open doors, press buton and fit in the pocket attached to the key chain.

This is an open project, you're alowed to do almost everything with it, expect making money out of what we develloped.

We'll be glad if you print it at home and use it ! Spread the project like the flu !
